# PicoloApp
Wlcome to my first app: **Picolo**.

Picolo is a drinking game that allows you to spend nice evenings with friends: just follow the instructions or answer the questions that the game proposes.

Unlike the other versions available on the various stores, my idea brings an additional level of abstraction: in the classic versions the instructions
are chosen from a list and the players who have to play in the round are randomly chosen. 

My version, instead, randomly creates a sentence and chooses both the players who will have to play and the sips they will have to drink as penance 
according to the chosen difficulty. With this method, you can easily increase the total number of phrases and hardly repeat phrases over the course 
of several games, allowing players to not always encounter the same rules. In addition there are viruses and phrases added that allow further fun. 

The graphics are not great, I have only 2 months of frontend behind me and I'm still not very familiar with ui/ux, all ie creations so far have been 
developed to be used only from the terminal.
