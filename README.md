# PicoloApp ![Alt text](/src/assets/beer.png)
Wlcome to my first app: **Picolo**.



Picolo is a drinking game that allows you to spend nice evenings with friends: just follow the instructions or answer the questions that the game proposes.

Unlike the other versions available on the various stores, my idea brings an additional level of abstraction: in the classic versions the instructions
are chosen from a list and the players who have to play in the round are randomly chosen. 

My version, instead, randomly creates a sentence and chooses both the players who will have to play and the sips they will have to drink as penance 
according to the chosen difficulty. With this method, you can easily increase the total number of phrases and hardly repeat phrases over the course 
of several games, allowing players to not always encounter the same rules. In addition there are viruses and phrases added that allow further fun. 
To simplify database management, the app tries to fetch the material from an external server, if it is not reachable there are phrases within the app that can be used locally

Graphic is simple, I have only 2 months of frontend behind me and I'm still not very familiar with ui/ux, all my creations so far have been 
developed to be used only from terminal.


In this version, we have the following features:

1. get db from external source
2. possibility to customize a game 
3. during the game you could add/edit/remove players and you can see which viruses are in play
4. there is a timer for some gaming comands to simplify the usability

What is currently not working: **/**

Future implementations:

1. being able to suggest a question
2. report possible sentence errors directly from the game

When I have time I will try to finalize the project, although already now I can call it finished.
#### If you want to try it you can download the latest apk in release and if you like it don't forget to give me a star
